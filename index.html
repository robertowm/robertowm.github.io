                                <p>As a member of Indexing Team, I worked in the development and maintenance of core solutions related to Full-Text Search and its indexing process. Our team goals were to provide the best eCommerce Search solution and ensure our customers' data are correctly processed and available for search.</p>
                                <p>The most relevant project was <span class="project-name">Dory</span>, the Full-Text Search solution used by its clients. Its technology stack was Java 8, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and Grizzly. One of the most important achievements I participated was prototyping a highly optimized Dory version for Near Real Time Indexing relying on Apache Kafka and several microservices for transforming, monitoring and inserting data to search servers.</p>
                                <p>Also, I maintained a project called <span class="project-name">SearchBuilder</span>, data processing pipeline responsible for consuming clients' data and transforming it into valid Search Indexes. Its technology stack was Java 8, RabbitMQ and CDH, Cloudera's distribution of Apache Hadoop.</p>

                                <p>As a member of Backoffice Team, I worked in the development of public APIs, web applications and internal services. As a team, we improved our solutions in a proactive approach, as we analyzed our customers using Full Story and Intercom to improve our features. Also, we were a fast-paced agile team using Kanban, supported by Jira, and Gitflow.</p>
                                <p>The most relevant project was <span class="project-name">Portal</span>, a new website where Stone clients can manage and validate their transactions. This project consisted of a UI using AngularJS, several microservices written in NodeJS and C#, and data stored on SQL Server. Before leaving the company, I developed prototypes using Redis and RethinkDB to improve overall performance.</p>

                                <p>As technical lead, I was responsible for technical decisions and development of Java and NodeJS scalable cloud-based platforms for data processing, including text enrichment, web crawlers, search and storage solutions. As senior development analyst, I audited the company’s BI platform and developed Java crawler solutions to our customers.</p>
                                <p>My main project was <span class="project-name">DataStore</span>, a data eCommerce to Cortex’s BI solution to manage and process distinct data types from internal and external providers. Its main features were real-time subscription simulation, historical purchase, and real-time data distribution. It is a cloud-based platform using Amazon cloud solutions, e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS and S3. Its technology stack was Java, Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and RethinkDB.</p>
                                <p>My last project was a new cloud-based data processing pipeline to crawl and transform data to <span class="project-name">DataStore</span>. Its main goal was to unify all data sources provided by Cortex Intelligence in one solution. Data pipeline was developed using Spring XD, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Crawlers were developed on Python using Scrapy and custom solutions written on Java. Integration between crawlers and the data pipeline relied on AWS SQS and AWS Kinesis. Elasticsearch and Kibana were used to monitor data quality and errors.</p>
