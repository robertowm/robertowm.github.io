    position: Cortex Intelligence
    summary: >-
      Cloud-based platform to aggregate, enrich, store and distribute structured
      and non-structured data, as crawled news, indexes and social media posts.
      Currently, it is in its second version. Its front-end was developed using
      AngularJS, LESS and Bootstrap. Its backend was developed using Java
      (Spring, JPA, Jersey, Retrofit) and Javascript (NodeJS). It uses many
      services available by Amazon. Also, it uses RabbitMQ to message-based
      communication and PostgreSQL, RethinkDB and Elasticsearch as databases.


      In its first version, it could collect data using a robust scheduler
      system. It monitored new demands and scheduled specific crawlers to
      collect a given data and deliver it directly to DataStore.
