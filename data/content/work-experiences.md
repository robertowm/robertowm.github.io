    summary: "At this moment I’m working with web solutions related to our new
      products. As a remote team, we're focused on agile principles to deliver
      new features as fast as possible, heavily focused on MVPs, and continuous
      improvements on our features.\r


      Our team's main focus is on developing new features to our main web
      platform, focused on selling and distribution of media to our customers.
      It is developed using a wide set of technologies related to modern web and
      microservices architecture. The most relevant technologies are Spring
      Boot, Spring Cloud, Angular, Typescript, Angular Material, MySQL, Redis,
      Kubernetes, and AWS.\r


      One of the main tasks I worked on recently is prototyping image
      processing algorithms for automatically applying templates on guest
      photos, focused on improving our product quality and reducing operational
      costs. Also, I participated in several major changes across the whole
      solution, like refactoring the analytics layer on the Front End project,
      to improve data quality and maintainability."

      I was working with web solutions, on greenfield projects related to its
      new strategies. Our team was focused on frontend development, ensuring
      high-quality systems to our users and integrating them with our modeling
      solutions and internal APIs, developed in Python.


      The most relevant project I participated in was the new user portal. It allows users to manage projects, events, and integrations related to Leapfrog. It is developed using React, Redux, Material UI, and Typescript. Other projects included shared UI components and API integrations, using a similar set of technologies. Also, they were maintained across distributed teams located in New Zealand and Canada.

      ensure our customers' data are correctly processed and available for
      search.


      The most relevant project was _Dory_, the Full-Text Search solution used by its clients. Its technology stack was Java 8, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and Grizzly. One of the most important achievements I participated was prototyping a highly optimized Dory version for Near Real Time Indexing relying on Apache Kafka and several microservices for transforming, monitoring and inserting data to search servers.


      Also, I maintained a project called _SearchBuilder_, data processing pipeline responsible for consuming clients' data and transforming it into valid Search Indexes. Its technology stack was Java 8, RabbitMQ and CDH, Cloudera's distribution of Apache Hadoop.

    start_year: "2012"
    summary: >-
      As technical lead, I was responsible for technical decisions and
      development of Java and NodeJS scalable cloud-based platforms for data
      processing, including text enrichment, web crawlers, search and storage
      solutions. As senior development analyst, I audited the company’s BI
      platform and developed Java crawler solutions to our customers.


      My main project was _DataStore_, a data eCommerce to Cortex’s BI solution to manage and process distinct data types from internal and external providers. Its main features were real-time subscription simulation, historical purchase, and real-time data distribution. It is a cloud-based platform using Amazon cloud solutions, e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS and S3. Its technology stack was Java, Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and RethinkDB.


      My last project was a new cloud-based data processing pipeline to crawl and transform data to _DataStore_. Its main goal was to unify all data sources provided by Cortex Intelligence in one solution. Data pipeline was developed using Spring XD, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Crawlers were developed on Python using Scrapy and custom solutions written on Java. Integration between crawlers and the data pipeline relied on AWS SQS and AWS Kinesis. Elasticsearch and Kibana were used to monitor data quality and errors.
