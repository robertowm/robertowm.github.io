summary: >-
  Cloud-based platform to aggregate, enrich, store and distribute structured and
  non-structured data, as crawled news, indexes and social media posts.
  Currently, it is in its second version. Its front-end was developed using
  AngularJS, LESS and Bootstrap. Its backend was developed using Java (Spring,
  JPA, Jersey, Retrofit) and Javascript (NodeJS). It uses many services
  available by Amazon. Also, it uses RabbitMQ to message-based communication and
  PostgreSQL, RethinkDB and Elasticsearch as databases.


  In its first version, it could collect data using a robust scheduler system.
  It monitored new demands and scheduled specific crawlers to collect a given
  data and deliver it directly to DataStore.
