summary: >-
  As systems analyst, I developed web systems in Java (JSP, JSF, JBoss Seam,
  Spring, JPA, Hibernate, AspectJ, Maven, Primefaces, Richfaces) and other
  technologies (SVN, Trac, Postgres, Oracle Database). A few months before
  leaving, I had the opportunity to manage a team using SCRUM.


  My most relevant projects were _IdUFF_ and _PIBIC_. _IdUFF_ was the academic
  system at UFF and I worked at the online class enrollment, with around 5000
  students accessing during one week each semester. _PIBIC_ is the institutional
  scientific initiation scholarship program given by CNPQ and I worked managing
  and developing a web system to manage all scholarship available at UFF.
