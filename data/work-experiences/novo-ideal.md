summary: >-
  As co-founder, I managed and developed web and mobile solutions, both using
  lean principles and emergent technologies, e.g. Google cloud solutions (Google
  App Engine and Google Cloud SQL) and Amazon cloud storage (AWS S3).


  My most relevant project was _DurmAki_, a cloud-based solution to rent rooms
  for students and events, e.g., carnival and conferences. It was implemented
  using Play Framework and deployed on Google cloud infrastructure.
