summary: >-
  As technical lead, I was responsible for technical decisions and development
  of Java and NodeJS scalable cloud-based platforms for data processing,
  including text enrichment, web crawlers, search and storage solutions. As
  senior development analyst, I audited the company’s BI platform and developed
  Java crawler solutions to our customers.


  My main project was _DataStore_, a data eCommerce to Cortex’s BI solution to
  manage and process distinct data types from internal and external providers.
  Its main features were real-time subscription simulation, historical purchase,
  and real-time data distribution. It is a cloud-based platform using Amazon
  cloud solutions, e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS and S3. Its technology
  stack was Java, Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL
  and RethinkDB.


  My last project was a new cloud-based data processing pipeline to crawl and
  transform data to _DataStore_. Its main goal was to unify all data sources
  provided by Cortex Intelligence in one solution. Data pipeline was developed
  using Spring XD, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Crawlers were developed on Python
  using Scrapy and custom solutions written on Java. Integration between
  crawlers and the data pipeline relied on AWS SQS and AWS Kinesis.
  Elasticsearch and Kibana were used to monitor data quality and errors.
