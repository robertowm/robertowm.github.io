summary: >-
  As a member of Backoffice Team, I worked in the development of public APIs,
  web applications and internal services. As a team, we improved our solutions
  in a proactive approach, as we analyzed our customers using Full Story and
  Intercom to improve our features. Also, we were a fast-paced agile team using
  Kanban, supported by Jira, and Gitflow.


  The most relevant project was _Portal_, a new website where Stone clients can
  manage and validate their transactions. This project consisted of a UI using
  AngularJS, several microservices written in NodeJS and C#, and data stored on
  SQL Server. Before leaving the company, I developed prototypes using Redis and
  RethinkDB to improve overall performance.
