  As a member of Indexing Team, I worked in the development and maintenance of
  core solutions related to Full-Text Search and its indexing process. Our team
  goals were to provide the best eCommerce Search solution and ensure our
  customers' data are correctly processed and available for search.


  The most relevant project was _Dory_, the Full-Text Search solution used by
  its clients. Its technology stack was Java 8, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and
  Grizzly. One of the most important achievements I participated was prototyping
  a highly optimized Dory version for Near Real Time Indexing relying on Apache
  Kafka and several microservices for transforming, monitoring and inserting
  data to search servers.


  Also, I maintained a project called _SearchBuilder_, data processing pipeline
  responsible for consuming clients' data and transforming it into valid Search
  Indexes. Its technology stack was Java 8, RabbitMQ and CDH, Cloudera's
  distribution of Apache Hadoop.
