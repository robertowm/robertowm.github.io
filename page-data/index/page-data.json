It allows users to manage projects, events, and integrations related to Leapfrog. It is developed using React, Redux, Material UI, and Typescript.\n\nOther projects include shared UI components and API integrations, using a similar set of technologies. Also, they are maintained across distributed teams located in New Zealand and Canada.","url":"https://www.seequent.com/","start_year":"2019","end_year":"Invalid date"},{"position":"Software Engineer","company":"SLI Systems","summary":"As a member of Indexing Team, I worked in the development and maintenance of core solutions related to Full-Text Search and its indexing process. Our team goals were to provide the best eCommerce Search solution and ensure our customers' data are correctly processed and available for search.\n\nThe most relevant project was _Dory_, the Full-Text Search solution used by its clients. Its technology stack was Java 8, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and Grizzly. One of the most important achievements I participated was prototyping a highly optimized Dory version for Near Real Time Indexing relying on Apache Kafka and several microservices for transforming, monitoring and inserting data to search servers.\n\nAlso, I maintained a project called _SearchBuilder_, data processing pipeline responsible for consuming clients' data and transforming it into valid Search Indexes. Its technology stack was Java 8, RabbitMQ and CDH, Cloudera's distribution of Apache Hadoop.","url":"https://www.sli-systems.com/","start_year":"2016","end_year":"2019"},{"position":"Software Engineer","company":"Stone","summary":"As a member of Backoffice Team, I worked in the development of public APIs, web applications and internal services. As a team, we improved our solutions in a proactive approach, as we analyzed our customers using Full Story and Intercom to improve our features. Also, we were a fast-paced agile team using Kanban, supported by Jira, and Gitflow.\n\nThe most relevant project was _Portal_, a new website where Stone clients can manage and validate their transactions. This project consisted of a UI using AngularJS, several microservices written in NodeJS and C#, and data stored on SQL Server.

As senior development analyst, I audited the company’s BI platform and developed Java crawler solutions to our customers.\n\nMy main project was _DataStore_, a data eCommerce to Cortex’s BI solution to manage and process distinct data types from internal and external providers. Its main features were real-time subscription simulation, historical purchase, and real-time data distribution. It is a cloud-based platform using Amazon cloud solutions, e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS and S3. Its technology stack was Java, Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and RethinkDB.\n\nMy last project was a new cloud-based data processing pipeline to crawl and transform data to _DataStore_. Its main goal was to unify all data sources provided by Cortex Intelligence in one solution. Data pipeline was developed using Spring XD, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Crawlers were developed on Python using Scrapy and custom solutions written on Java. Integration between crawlers and the data pipeline relied on AWS SQS and AWS Kinesis. Elasticsearch and Kibana were used to monitor data quality and errors.","url":"http://www.cortex-intelligence.com/","start_year":"2012","end_year":"2015"},{"position":"Co-founder","company":"Novo Ideal","summary":"As co-founder, I managed and developed web and mobile solutions, both using lean principles and emergent technologies, e.g. Google cloud solutions (Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL) and Amazon cloud storage (AWS S3).\n\nMy most relevant project was _DurmAki_, a cloud-based solution to rent rooms for students and events, e.g., carnival and conferences.
