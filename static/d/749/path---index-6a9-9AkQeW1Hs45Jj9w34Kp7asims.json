Its technology stack was Java 8, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and Grizzly. One of the most important achievements I participated was prototyping a highly optimized Dory version for Near Real Time Indexing relying on Apache Kafka and several microservices for transforming, monitoring and inserting data to search servers.\n\nAlso, I maintained a project called _SearchBuilder_, data processing pipeline responsible for consuming clients' data and transforming it into valid Search Indexes.

Its main features were real-time subscription simulation, historical purchase, and real-time data distribution. It is a cloud-based platform using Amazon cloud solutions, e.g., EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS and S3. Its technology stack was Java, Spring, NodeJS, AngularJS, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and RethinkDB.\n\nMy last project was a new cloud-based data processing pipeline to crawl and transform data to _DataStore_. Its main goal was to unify all data sources provided by Cortex Intelligence in one solution. Data pipeline was developed using Spring XD, RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Crawlers were developed on Python using Scrapy and custom solutions written on Java. Integration between crawlers and the data pipeline relied on AWS SQS and AWS Kinesis. Elasticsearch and Kibana were used to monitor data quality and errors.","url":"http://www.cortex-intelligence.com/","start_year":"2012","end_year":"2015"},{"position":"Co-founder","company":"Novo Ideal","summary":"As co-founder, I managed and developed web and mobile solutions, both using lean principles and emergent technologies, e.g. Google cloud solutions (Google App Engine and Google Cloud SQL) and Amazon cloud storage (AWS S3).\n\nMy most relevant project was _DurmAki_, a cloud-based solution to rent rooms for students and events, e.g., carnival and conferences.
